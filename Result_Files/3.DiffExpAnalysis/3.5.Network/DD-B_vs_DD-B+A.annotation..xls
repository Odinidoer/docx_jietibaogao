It also releases bradykinin from HMW kininogen and may also play a role in the renin-angiotensin system by converting prorenin into renin	http://smart.embl.de/smart/DD2.cgi?smart=638:APPLE(21|104)+APPLE(111|194)+APPLE(201|284)+APPLE(292|375)+Tryp_SPc(390|621)+
Lcp1	Q3TJX0	lymphocyte cytosolic protein 1; Actin-binding protein. Plays a role in the activation of T-cells in response to costimulation through TCR/CD3 and CD2 or CD28.

Tnnc1	P19123	troponin C, cardiac/slow skeletal; Troponin is the central regulatory protein of striated muscle contraction. Tn consists of three components: Tn-I which is the inhibitor of actomyosin ATPase, Tn-T which contains the binding site for tropomyosin and Tn-C. The binding of calcium to Tn-C abolishes the inhibitory action of Tn on actin filaments	http://smart.embl.de/smart/DD2.cgi?smart=161:EFh(19|48)+EFh(56|84)+EFh(96|124)+EFh(132|160)+
